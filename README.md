# portfolio-projects

Hello! This is a collection of projects I am working on in order to build my skills in data analytics. Some were assigned through the Coursera Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course as well as the Codecademy Data Analyst Career Path. Some are completely my own.

# What are you working on now?

Inspired by [#GamesNightViz](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz), I am looking at [Jeopardy! data](https://www.j-archive.com/) to determine how often people "make it a true daily double" - and how successful they are! I'm excited about this project, because it's giving me practice with several new-to-me skills, such as:
- Web scraping
- Processing unstructured data
- More Tableau!

Some questions rolling around in my head related to this topic:
- How often do people really "make it a true daily double"?
- Are players more or less successful if they risk it all?
- Are players more successful if they make it a true daily double when the question appears in the top half of the board?
- Are players more inclined to risk it all if they are behind?

This is currently a work in progress and feedback is always welcomed!
